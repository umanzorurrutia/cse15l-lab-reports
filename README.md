## About The Project

This is my first lab report for CSE 15L at UC San Diego. This report covers the `cd`, `ls`, and `cat` commands.

Tests:
* An example of the command with *no* arguments.
* An example of the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
* An example of the command with a path to a file as an argument.
