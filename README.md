## About The Project

This is my first lab report for CSE 15L at UC San Diego. This report covers the `cd`, `ls`, and `cat` commands.

Tests:
* An example of the command with *no* arguments.
* An example of the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
* An example of the command with a path to a file as an argument.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
